### Design and Analysis of Algorithms

###### Description

"In this course, students will learn important data structures in computer science and acquire fundamental algorithm design techniques to get the efficient solutions to several computing problems from various disciplines. Topics include the analysis of algorithm efficiency, hash, heap, graph, tree, sorting and searching, brute force, divide-and-conquer, decrease-and conquer, transform-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy programming." - *Professor Byun 2017*


 - Note: This course is required and one of the challenging courses in the curriculum. 
 
 
 - Personal Objectives: Upload various course work to demonstrate prior coding achievements and shortcomings. This will act as a reflective tool for self-improvement as to reacquaint concepts. Furthermore, recoding it into Java would help expand both languages since some time has passed for the reason that detailed linguistic nuance of Java and C++ are important.
