### Design and Analysis of Algorithms

###### Description

"In this course, students will learn important data structures in computer science and acquire fundamental algorithm design techniques to get the efficient solutions to several computing problems from various disciplines. Topics include the analysis of algorithm efficiency, hash, heap, graph, tree, sorting and searching, brute force, divide-and-conquer, decrease-andconquer, transform-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy programming." - *Professor Byun 2017*
